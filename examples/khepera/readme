A reactive path planning problem for a unicycle dynamics modeling the Khepera 4
robot

0. To run this example, you need to the Cudd libarary installed. Please see the
   manual for installation notes.

1. edit the Makefile 
   adjust the compiler to your programming environment

2. compile the synthesis.cc
   $ make
   in a terminal

3. execute 

  $./synthesis

  which produces

  ./controller.scs
  ./controller.bdd
  ./obstacles.scs
  ./obstacles.bdd
  ./target.scs
  ./target.bdd
  ./gate.scs
  ./gate.bdd

4. simulate the closed loop in MATLAB 
  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )
  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 
   >> addpath(genpath('../../mfiles'))
   >> simulate
